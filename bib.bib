% These entries should be organized with one blank line between them and in
% alphabetical order of citation key, which is almost always the first author's
% last name, the year of publication, and the first non-trivial word of the
% title. For example, if citing JD Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye" from
% 1951, the citation key would be salinger1951catcher.
