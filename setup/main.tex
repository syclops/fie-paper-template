% This is the setup file. It contains usepackage commands, acronyms, and other
% useful commands needed to set up the paper. Uncomment the relevant sections to
% use them.

% Some commands rely on a conditional to have different behavior when the final
% manuscript is submitted. (e.g., showing author information). Uncomment
% \submittrue below to use submit-time behavior, and \submitfalse to use default
% behavior. If both lines are uncommented, whatever comes later will take
% precedence.
\newif\ifsubmit{}  % Flag for distinguishing submission commands
%\submittrue{}
\submitfalse{}
