% Setup preamble
%
% This is the place for anything that needs to be executed before package
% includes, command definitions, and the like. If copying from a template,
% anything in the template that doesn't fit elsewhere in setup and comes before
% the \begin{document} command should go here.

% This is only needed to identify funding in the first footnote, and can be
% removed if not needed.
